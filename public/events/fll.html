          <h3 class="heading-16">Cesar Tacuri</h3>
          <p><strong>My name is Cesar Tacuri, and I am Civil Engineering major on his junior year. I joined LAESA in Spring of 2019. Being a transfer student, it was hard adjusting to a new school and a new community. As I explored my campus and its resources, I came across LAESA. Throughout the next semester, I decided to become a more active member and experienced what LAESA was truly about. They’re a group of students inspiring and encouraging other students through a strong work ethic, accomplishments, and discipline. Personally, I wanted to give new students the same tools and knowledge LAESA had given me. So, in Fall of 2019, I became the co-director of Recruitment and Retention, First Lego League (FLL), and Pre-College Engineering Day (PCED) Logistics. I made sure I was well known by my peers and that my peers were well known, too. LAESA will forever be my life’s best chapter not only for the professional development but for the friends I’ve made. I am proud to be a LAESA member.</strong></p>
